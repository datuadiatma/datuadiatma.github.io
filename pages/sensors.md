# Temperature and Humidity Levels

{% include sensor.html %}

The charts above are showing temperature and humidity levels in my home working space. Temperature and humidity are measured on DHT-22 sensor from gowoops interfaced to a raspberry pi zero single-board cpu. Dashboard was built on initialstate.
