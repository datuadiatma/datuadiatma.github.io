Hello, my name is Datu Adiatma. I am a PhD student in geology at OSU [School of Earth Sciences ](https://earthsciences.osu.edu). If I am not out in the field wacking some rocks, you can find me running on [olentangy trail](https://www.columbus.gov/recreationandparks/trails/Olentangy-Trail/). I put my random thoughts on [here](/blog).

Thanks for stopping by, and Rock on!
