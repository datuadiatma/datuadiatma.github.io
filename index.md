Hello there!

My name is Datu. I am a PhD student at OSU's [School of Earth Sciences ](https://earthsciences.osu.edu). My research focuses on the Taconic orogeny, a mountain building event along the eastern part of the North American Continent that took place ~ 470 million years ago, and its impact on global climate and basin subsidence.

My main 'tool' in answering my research questions is chemostratigraphy. It's a branch of stratigraphy that uses changes in chemical composition in the rock record to decode various changes in the earth system and correlate rocks strata across different sedimentary basins.
