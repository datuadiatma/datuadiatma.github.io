Hello, my name is Datu Adiatma. I am a PhD student in geology at OSU's [School of Earth Sciences ](https://earthsciences.osu.edu). My research focuses on the Taconic orogeny, a mountain building event along the eastern part of the North America Continent that took place ~ 470 million years ago, and its impact in global climate and basin subsidence.

My main 'tools' in answering my research questions is chemostratigraphy. It's a branch of stratigraphy that uses changes in chemical composition of the rock record through time to decode various changes in the earth system,

Thanks for reading!
