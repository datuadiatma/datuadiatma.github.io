Hello this is my first blog post. I have had some forms of blogs over the past 10 years or so.  Starting from an eye-irritating first blog I built on [blogpost](https://gottsegne.blogspot.com/) platform, to a more urbane-looking but slow self-hosted wordpress. At last, after a ten-year long soul searching of my design philosophy, I've decided to put my money on a static website generator called [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). <!--more-->

Unlike cms-style dynamically generated content blogs, this webstie now consists of [static html pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) which I generated using jekyll (because I do not have the luxury of time to learn html, css, and those fancy web programming languages). The fact that the contents are static hopefully makes this website quicker to load on web browsers and safer.

This is of course a work in progress (will probably be always a work in progress), so thanks for stopping by. I am commited to post at least twice a month on this site. My posts will mostly be related to geology, python programming, or random rants about how I couldn't reproduce the sweet bright fruity taste of my black coffee I brew every morning.
